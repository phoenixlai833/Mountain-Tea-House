# Mountain Tea House

**Mountain Tea House** is a tea house concept that I imagined in a first semester design course at BCIT. I wanted a semi-upscale brand that appeals to fellow tea connoisseurs and evokes a calming, atmospheric feeling.

The class focused on the design process where I created a style guide, low-fidelity wireframes, and a high-fidelity prototype in Figma. I continued to pursue the project on my own time to implement the vision I had for the website. I made sure the pages were fully responsive for different screen sizes and because it is static, I deployed it on netlify. Feel free to check it out!
